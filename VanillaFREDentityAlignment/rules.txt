DEFINITION OF RULES 


1. rule for align entities (function "mergeSimilarity")
If there is a path walking through fred nodes whereby the relations are called "sameas", "rdfsclassof", "rdfssubclassof", "rdftype"
use the first entity and the first relation to connect directly to the dbpedia entity (in the example "dul:associatedWith").

if through this process entities are to be removed, which are link to other "valid" paths, the latter must be linked to first valid parent 

for every fred entity removed like this, we need to remove (maybe easily by string manipulation) all the chunk automatically generated 
by FRED to produce that

2. remove disconnected triples

3. remove POS

#script to parse a FRED generated Turtle into a cleaner version (entity alignment, link pruning)

#rationalia: 
# keep all words
# remove all FRED sameAS
# remove all possible types and entities
#   check all owl:equivalentclass -  keep them only if they really match the original string (insert the original string into the file)
# remove disconnected things
# remove pos tags
# begins ends 
# check boxers
# refersto
